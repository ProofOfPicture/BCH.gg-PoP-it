# PoP it
Website for the PoP it app created at the BCH DEVCON Amsterdam 2018

The PoP it app is a camera app with a build in BCH wallet that allows you to take a picture and store a hash (sha256) of a Picture on the BCH Blockchain with Op_Return. This allows you to provide visual evidence for any usecase but with the the specific benifits that a Blockchain can provide such as timestamping and proof of ownership.
